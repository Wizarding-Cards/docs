# Getting Started with Wizarding Cards

Welcome to Wizarding Cards! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to begin your magical card collecting journey.

## Step 1: Claim Your First Card

The most important command you'll use is `/claim`. This is how you collect new cards! When you use `/claim`, the bot will:

1. Give you a random card from the collection
2. Show you the card's rarity and details
3. Award you Galleons (the game currency)
4. Grant you XP to level up
5. Start or continue your claiming streak

!!! tip "Your First Claim"
    Your very first claim is free! After that, you'll need to wait 30 minutes between claims (20 minutes if you vote, or 10 minutes if you're an Auror subscriber).

## Step 2: View Your Profile

Check out your stats and collection with `/profile`. Your profile shows:

- **Level & XP** - Your progress and experience points
- **Galleons** - Your currency balance
- **Streak** - Your current claiming streak
- **Statistics** - Total claims, crafts, and disenchants
- **Cards Collected** - Progress towards completing the collection
- **Collection Breakdown** - Cards owned by rarity

!!! note "Understanding Icons"
    When viewing your collection:

    - <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/owned.png" alt="Owned" class="hp-emoji"> = You own this card
    - <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/notowned.png" alt="Not Owned" class="hp-emoji"> = You don't own this card yet
    - <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/craftable.png" alt="Craftable" class="hp-emoji"> = You can craft this card with your current resources

## Step 3: Build Your Streak

The **streak system** is key to finding rare cards. Each time you claim a card within the cooldown period, your streak increases.

**Benefits of Streaks:**

- Higher streaks = Better odds of higher rarity cards
- Streak multiplies your Galleon rewards
- Shows your dedication to the game

**Maintaining Your Streak:**

- Claim at least once every 12 hours (24 hours for Aurors)
- Set reminders to keep your streak alive
- Missing the window will reset your streak to 0

## Step 4: Complete Daily Quests

Every day at midnight GMT/BST, you'll receive 4 new quests to complete. Use `/daily` to check your quests and see when they reset in your local time. Quests might ask you to:

## Step 5: Vote for Rewards

## Step 6: Explore the Shop

Once you have Galleons, visit the shop with `/shop`. The shop offers:

- **Resource Caches** - Bundles of crafting resources (Small, Medium, Large)
- **Potions** - Items that modify crafting costs, reset cooldowns, or boost claims
- **Seasonal Crates** - Special event crates during Halloween and Christmas events
