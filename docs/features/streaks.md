# Streak System

The **streak system** is one of the most important mechanics in Wizarding Cards. Your streak represents consecutive claims without letting too much time pass between them, and provides massive benefits for dedicated players.

## What is a Streak?

A streak is the number of consecutive times you've claimed a card while staying within the time window.

**Example:**
```
Day 1: Claim at 8 AM → Streak: 1
Day 1: Claim at 2 PM (6 hours later) → Streak: 2
Day 1: Claim at 8 PM (6 hours later) → Streak: 3
Day 2: Claim at 8 AM (12 hours later) → Streak: 4
```

## Streak Requirements

### Time Windows

You must claim within these windows to maintain your streak:

| Player Type | Maximum Time Between Claims |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| **Regular Players** | 12 hours |
| **Auror (Premium)** | 24 hours |

!!! danger "Streak Reset"
    If you exceed the time window, your streak resets to 0 and you must start over!

### Claim Cooldown

Remember that claiming has a cooldown:

| Player Type | Claim Cooldown |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Regular Players** | 30 minutes |
| **Voters** | 20 minutes |
| **Auror (Premium)** | 10 minutes |

**This means:**
- Minimum 30 minutes between claims (20 if you vote, 10 for Aurors)
- Maximum 12 hours to maintain streak (24 for Aurors)
- Sweet spot: Claim every 30 minutes to 6 hours

## Streak Benefits

Higher streaks provide three major advantages:

### 1. <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/card.png" alt="Card" class="hp-emoji"> Increased Rare Card Odds

Your chances of claiming rare cards increase dramatically:

| Streak Range | Rare Card Bonus |
|--------------|-----------------|
| 1-10 | Base odds (no bonus) |
| 11-25 | +10% rare card chance |
| 26-50 | +20% rare card chance |
| 51-100 | +30% rare card chance |
| 100-200 | +40% rare card chance |
| 200+ | +50% rare card chance |

**Example:**
- Base legendary chance: 4%
- With 100+ streak: 4% × 1.4 = 5.6% (40% increase!)
- With 200+ streak: 4% × 1.5 = 6% (50% increase!)

### 2. <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/galleons.png" alt="Galleons" class="hp-emoji"> Galleon Multiplier

Set reminders at:
- 6 hours after claim (buffer time)
- 7 hours after claim (warning)
- 7.5 hours after claim (urgent)

Use:
- Phone alarms
- Discord bots
- Calendar notifications
- Smart watch alerts

Buy from: `/shop`

**3. Claiming Before Sleep** 🌙

**Strategy:**
- Claim right before bed
- Extends your streak window through the night
- Gives you 8 hours (12 for Aurors) to wake up and claim

**Example:**
```
10 PM: Claim before bed
6 AM: Wake up, still have 2 hours (regular) or 10 hours (Auror)
```

**4. Auror Subscription** <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/gem.png" alt="Gem" class="hp-emoji">

The 12-hour window makes streak maintenance MUCH easier:

- 50% more time to claim

- Miss a claim session without panic
- Worth it for serious streak builders

## Advanced Streak Strategies

### The "Claim Sandwich"

**Strategy:** Claim at start and end of your active day

**Example:**
```
8 AM: Morning claim
11 AM: Mid-morning claim
2 PM: Afternoon claim
8 PM: Evening claim before bed
```

Creates buffer window overnight!

### Timezone Exploitation

When traveling east:
- Days are shorter
- More claims fit in calendar day
- Use for streak building

When traveling west:
- Days are longer
- Extra time between claims
- Easier to maintain streak

### The "Weekend Warrior"

**Strategy:** Extra claims on weekends

**Weekday:** 3 claims/day
**Weekend:** 4-5 claims/day

Accelerates early streak building!
