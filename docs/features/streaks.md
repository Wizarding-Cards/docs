# Streak System

The **streak system** is one of the most important mechanics in Wizarding Cards. Your streak represents consecutive claims without letting too much time pass between them, and provides massive benefits for dedicated players.

## What is a Streak?

A streak is the number of consecutive times you've claimed a card while staying within the time window.

**Example:**

- 8:00 AM: Claim → Streak: 1
- 8:30 AM: Claim (30 min later) → Streak: 2
- 9:00 AM: Claim (30 min later) → Streak: 3
- 2:00 PM: Claim (5 hours later) → Streak: 4
- 8:00 PM: Claim (6 hours later) → Streak: 5
- Next day 8:00 AM: Claim (12 hours later) → Streak: 6

## Streak Requirements

### Time Windows

You must claim within these windows to maintain your streak:

| Player Type | Maximum Time Between Claims |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| **<img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/regular.png" alt="Regular" class="hp-emoji"> Regular Players** | 12 hours |
| **<img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/auror.png" alt="Auror" class="hp-emoji"> Auror (Premium)** | 24 hours |

!!! danger "Streak Reset"
    If you exceed the time window, your streak resets to 0 and you must start over!

### Claim Cooldown

Remember that claiming has a cooldown:

| Player Type | Claim Cooldown |
|-------------|---------------|
| **<img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/regular.png" alt="Regular" class="hp-emoji"> Regular Players** | 30 minutes |
| **<img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/vote.png" alt="Vote" class="hp-emoji"> Voters** | 20 minutes |
| **<img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/auror.png" alt="Auror" class="hp-emoji"> Auror (Premium)** | 10 minutes |

**This means:**

- Minimum 30 minutes between claims (20 if you vote, 10 for <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/auror.png" alt="Auror" class="hp-emoji"> Aurors)
- Maximum 12 hours to maintain streak (24 for <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/auror.png" alt="Auror" class="hp-emoji"> Aurors)
- Sweet spot: Claim every 30 minutes to 6 hours

## Streak Benefits

Higher streaks provide two major advantages:

### 1. <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/card.png" alt="Card" class="hp-emoji"> Increased Rare Card Odds

Your chances of claiming rare cards (Legendary and Mythic) increase with higher streaks:

**How it works:**

- Streak reduces the odds denominator by `streak × 0.001` (capped at streak 5000)
- Only affects rarities that can be shiny (Legendary and Mythic)
- Maximum bonus: Reduction of 5 to the odds denominator at streak 5000+

**Example:**

- Base Legendary odds: 1 in 20 (5%)
- At streak 1000: Odds improve to approximately 1 in 19
- At streak 5000+: Maximum bonus applied (reduction of 5 to odds denominator)

!!! note "Streak Bonus"
    The streak bonus only affects Legendary and Mythic cards (rarities that can be shiny). Common, Uncommon, and Rare cards are not affected by streak.

### 2. <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/trophies.png" alt="Trophies" class="hp-emoji"> Status and Recognition

- Visible on your profile

## Protecting Your Streak

### Essential Tools

<img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/timeturner.png" alt="Timeturner" class="hp-emoji"> **1. Multiple Reminders**

Set reminders at:

- 6 hours after claim (buffer time)
- 7 hours after claim (warning)
- 7.5 hours after claim (urgent)

Use:

- Phone alarms
- Discord bots
- Calendar notifications
- Smart watch alerts

<img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/timeturner.png" alt="Time Turner" class="hp-emoji"> **2. Time Turners**

- Keep 2-3 in inventory always
- Cost 250 <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/galleons.png" alt="Galleons" class="hp-emoji"> Galleons each
- Instantly reset claim cooldown
- Use in emergencies only

Buy from: `/shop`

**3. Claiming Before Sleep**

**Strategy:**

- Claim right before bed
- Extends your streak window through the night
- Gives you up to 12 hours (24 for <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/auror.png" alt="Auror" class="hp-emoji"> Aurors) to wake up and claim

**Example:**

- 10 PM: Claim before bed
- 6 AM: Wake up, still have 6 hours (regular) or 18 hours (<img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/auror.png" alt="Auror" class="hp-emoji"> Auror)

<img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/auror.png" alt="Auror" class="hp-emoji"> **4. Auror Subscription**

The 24-hour window makes streak maintenance MUCH easier:

- 100% more time to claim (double the regular window)
- Sleep through entire nights safely
- Miss a claim session without panic
- Worth it for serious streak builders

## Advanced Streak Strategies

### The "Claim Sandwich"

**Strategy:** Claim at start and end of your active day

**Example:**

- 8 AM: Morning claim
- 11 AM: Mid-morning claim
- 2 PM: Afternoon claim
- 8 PM: Evening claim before bed

Creates buffer window overnight!

### Timezone Exploitation

When traveling east:

- Days are shorter
- More claims fit in calendar day
- Use for streak building

When traveling west:

- Days are longer
- Extra time between claims
- Easier to maintain streak

### The "Weekend Warrior"

**Strategy:** Extra claims on weekends

**Weekday:** 3 claims/day

**Weekend:** 4-5 claims/day

Accelerates early streak building!
