## Collection Strategies

### For Beginners

**Focus Areas:**
1. Claim regularly to build base collection
2. Don't worry about completion yet
3. Learn the rarity system
4. Start accumulating resources

### For Intermediate Players

**Efficiency Tips:**
1. Complete Common cards first (easiest)
2. Use Duplicate Prevention strategically
3. Craft missing rares and legendaries
4. Save resources for targeted crafting

### For Advanced Players

**Completion Tactics:**
1. Systematic rarity completion
2. Maximum use of Duplicate Prevention
3. Craft all craftable cards (orange icons)
4. Hunt for final Mythics and variants

## Collection Progress Tracking

### Completion Percentage

Calculated as:
```
(Unique Cards Owned / Total Available) × 100
```

**Example:**
```
156/289 = 53.98% complete
```

### Rarity Progress

Track each rarity separately:

```
Common: 45/60 (75%)
Uncommon: 32/50 (64%)
Rare: 18/40 (45%)
Legendary: 8/20 (40%)
Mythic: 2/15 (13.3%)
Cursed: 1/4 (25%)
```

### Variant Collection

For completionists:

- Regular versions (base collection)
- Shiny versions (bonus collectibles)
- Gold versions (ultra-rare collectibles)

All three are tracked separately!
