## Competing for Ranks

### Short-term Competition (Streak Leaderboard)

The **streak leaderboard** is the most dynamic:

- Changes daily as streaks break and rebuild
- Achievable for newer players
- Requires consistency over raw time investment

**Strategy:**

1. Set multiple reminders
2. Never miss a claim window
3. Consider <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/auror.png" alt="Auror" class="hp-emoji"> Auror for easier maintenance
4. Claim before bed

### Long-term Competition (Claims/Level)

**Claims** and **Level** leaderboards favor long-term players:

- Accumulate over months/years
- Steady progress > bursts of activity
- Consistency wins

**Strategy:**

1. Play daily
2. Complete all daily quests
3. Maximise each claim session
4. Never take long breaks

## Leaderboard Updates

### Update Frequency

Leaderboards are cached and refreshed every **10 minutes**:

- Leaderboards are calculated and cached for 10 minutes
- A scheduled task refreshes all leaderboards every 10 minutes
- Your rank may not reflect the most recent actions immediately
- Check back in a few minutes to see updated standings

### Seasonal Resets

Some leaderboards may have seasonal variants:

- **Monthly Leaderboards** - Reset each month

- **Event Leaderboards** - Active during special events

- **All-time Leaderboards** - Never reset (permanent)

## Tips for Climbing Leaderboards

!!! tip "Ranking Up"
    **General Strategies:**

    1. **Choose Your Category** - Focus on one leaderboard at a time
    2. **Consistency > Bursts** - Regular play beats sporadic hardcore sessions
    3. **Optimise Daily Routine** - Follow the [daily routine guide](../daily-routine.md)
    4. **Set Goals** - Aim for specific ranks (e.g., "Top 100", "Top 50")
    5. **Stay Motivated** - Track your progress week by week
    6. **Learn from Leaders** - See what top players are doing differently

### Streak Leaderboard Strategy

**Understanding the Time Window:**

- **Regular Players:** Must claim within **12 hours** to maintain streak
- **<img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/auror.png" alt="Auror" class="hp-emoji"> Auror Subscribers:** Must claim within **24 hours** to maintain streak
- Claim cooldown: 30 minutes (regular), 20 minutes (voters), 10 minutes (<img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/auror.png" alt="Auror" class="hp-emoji"> Aurors)

**Key Strategies:**

- **Set Multiple Reminders:** Don't rely on a single reminder. Set reminders at 6, 8, and 10 hours to give yourself buffer time
- **Claim Before Sleep:** Always claim right before bed to maximize the time until your next required claim
- **Plan for Travel:** If you'll be away or sleeping for extended periods, use <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/timeturner.png" alt="Time Turner" class="hp-emoji"> Time Turners to extend your window
- **Consider <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/auror.png" alt="Auror" class="hp-emoji"> Auror Subscription:** The 24-hour window makes maintaining high streaks significantly easier
- **Build Gradually:** Don't try to claim every 30 minutes - find a sustainable rhythm (every 6-8 hours works well)
- **Emergency Backup:** Keep <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/timeturner.png" alt="Time Turner" class="hp-emoji"> Time Turners in your inventory for unexpected situations
- **Consistency Over Frequency:** It's better to claim every 8 hours consistently than to claim every 30 minutes for a day and then miss a window

### Level Leaderboard Strategy

**Focus Points:**

- Complete all 4 daily quests every day
- Vote on all sites twice daily
- Craft and disenchant actively
- Participate in all events
- Use <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/xp.png" alt="Xp" class="hp-emoji"> XP boosters during multiplier events
