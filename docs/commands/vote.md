## Voting Process

### Step-by-Step

1. **Use `/vote`** in Discord
2. **Click a site button** (opens in browser)
3. **Log in** to the voting site (if needed)
4. **Click the vote button** on the site
5. **Return to Discord** - rewards are automatic!
6. **Repeat** for other sites

### Automatic Rewards

Rewards are credited automatically when you vote:

![Vote Success](https://wizarding.cards/assets/screenshots/Vote.jpg)

## Voting Cooldown

Each site has a **12-hour cooldown**:

- Vote every 12 hours per site
- Cooldowns are independent (each site separate)
- You can vote on all sites at once, then again 12 hours later
- The bot tracks when you last voted on each site (shown in the voting interface above)

## Voting Strategy

### Maximum Earnings

To maximise your voting rewards:

**Daily Routine:**

1. **Morning:** Vote on all available sites
2. **Evening** (12 hours later): Vote again on all sites

**Potential Daily Earnings:**

- 4 sites × 2 votes = 8 votes per day
- 8 votes × 10 Galleons = **80 Galleons/day**
- 8 votes × 200 XP = **1,600 XP/day**

That's **560 Galleons and 11,200 XP per week** just from voting!

### Quest Integration

Voting counts toward daily quests:

- "Vote on 1 Voting Site"
- "Vote on 2 Voting Sites"
- "Vote on 3 Voting Sites"
- "Vote on 4 Voting Sites"

**Strategy:**

Vote immediately when you see a vote quest to complete it quickly!

## Common Voting Issues

### "Vote not registering"

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Wrong Account** - Make sure you're logged into the voting site with your Discord account
2. **Already Voted** - Check if cooldown hasn't expired yet
3. **Site Down** - Voting site may be temporarily offline
4. **Network Issues** - Try again in a few minutes

**Solutions:**

- Wait for full cooldown to expire (12 hours)
- Clear browser cookies and try again
- Use a different browser
- Contact support if issue persists

### "Didn't receive rewards"

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Vote still processing** - Can take 1-2 minutes
2. **Site API delay** - Sometimes there's a delay between vote and reward
3. **Incorrect account** - Voted with wrong Discord account
4. **System-wide issue** - If rewards aren't working, it affects all users

**Note:**

Rewards are automated and cannot be manually granted. If you didn't receive rewards, it's likely a system-wide issue affecting all users. The bot will automatically process rewards when the voting site's API is working correctly. Please wait and try voting again later.
