2. **Click a site button** (opens in browser)
3. **Log in** to the voting site (if needed)

## Voting Cooldown

Each site has a **12-hour cooldown**:

- Vote every 12 hours per site
- Cooldowns are independent (each site separate)
- You can vote on all sites at once, then again 12 hours later

### Cooldown Tracking

The bot tracks when you last voted on each site:

```
<img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/check.png" alt="Check" class="hp-emoji"> Top.gg: Available now!
<img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/timeturner.png" alt="Timeturner" class="hp-emoji"> Discord Bot List: Available in 3 hours
<img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/timeturner.png" alt="Timeturner" class="hp-emoji"> Discords.com: Available in 8 hours
```

## Voting Strategy

### Maximum Earnings

To maximise your voting rewards:

**Daily Routine:**
1. **Morning:** Vote on all available sites
2. **Evening** (12 hours later): Vote again on all sites

**Potential Daily Earnings:**
- 4 sites × 2 votes = 8 votes per day
- 8 votes × 10 Galleons = **80 Galleons/day**
- 8 votes × 200 XP = **1,600 XP/day**

That's **560 Galleons and 11,200 XP per week** just from voting!

### Quest Integration

Voting counts toward daily quests:

- "Vote on 1 Voting Site"
- "Vote on 2 Voting Sites"
- "Vote on 3 Voting Sites"
- "Vote on 4 Voting Sites"

**Strategy:** Vote immediately when you see a vote quest to complete it quickly!

You can opt-in to receive DM reminders when votes are available:

1. Use `/profile`

3. Toggle **Voting Reminders** to <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/check.png" alt="Check" class="hp-emoji"> **Enabled**
