## Common Profile Questions

### "Why does my <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/xp.png" alt="Xp" class="hp-emoji"> XP bar look wrong?"

The bar shows progress toward your **next** level, not total XP.

### "My collection percentage seems low"

Total cards increase as new cards are added to the game. Your percentage may fluctuate.

### "Where are my old statistics?"

Some stats may be archived or reset during major updates. Core stats are always preserved.

## Troubleshooting

### "Profile not loading"
- **Cause:** Temporary bot issue
- **Solution:** Wait and try `/profile` again

### "Cannot view another user's profile"
- **Cause:** They may have claimed their first card yet
- **Solution:** They need to use `/claim` first

### "Collection button not working"
- **Cause:** Too many cards causing timeout
- **Solution:** Try again, or use search to navigate
