- Level up rewards
- Seasonal events

### How Much to Save

**General Guidelines:**

- **Emergency Fund:** <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/galleons.png" alt="Galleons" class="hp-emoji"> 300-500 (for <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/rapidreclamationremedy.png" alt="Rapid Reclamation Remedy" class="hp-emoji"> Rapid Reclamation Remedy to protect streaks)

!!! tip "Save for Events!"
    Set aside Galleons before seasonal events - they often have limited-time items worth buying!

## Special Offers

Occasionally, the shop features special deals:

- **Limited Time Discounts** - Items on sale
- **Bundle Deals** - Multiple items at reduced cost
- **Event Exclusives** - Only available during events

Watch for announcements in the support server!

## Item Stacking

Some effects stack, others don't:

**Do Stack:**

- Multiple Rapid Bounty Draught uses (each use adds 5 more cards per claim)
- Frugality Flasks work independently (Basic for Common/Uncommon/Rare, Advanced for Legendary/Mythic)
- Potions + High Streaks (multiplicative benefits!)

**Don't Stack:**

- Multiple Frugality Flasks of the same type (only one active at a time)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ **Buying Items You Don't Need** - Plan your purchases
- ❌ **Not Using Items** - Items are meant to be used!
- ❌ **Spending All Your Galleons** - Keep an emergency fund for Rapid Reclamation Remedy
- ❌ **Ignoring Level Requirements** - Save up for when you unlock better items
- ❌ **Buying Resource Caches Too Early** - Better to claim naturally and disenchant duplicates first

## Troubleshooting

### "You don't have enough Galleons"
- **Cause:** Insufficient Galleon balance
- **Solution:** Earn more through claiming, voting, and quests

### "This item is locked"
- **Cause:** You haven't reached the required level
- **Solution:** Continue playing to level up

### "Item purchase failed"
- **Cause:** Temporary bot issue
- **Solution:** Wait and try again

A: Not currently - items are account-bound.

**Q: Do shop prices ever change?**

A: Occasionally during events or balance updates.

**Q: Can I buy items with real money?**
