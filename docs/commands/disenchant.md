# Disenchant Command

The `/disenchant` command allows you to convert unwanted or duplicate cards into resources, which you can then use to craft specific cards you need.

## How to Use

```
/disenchant
```

When you use this command, you'll see:

1. A list of cards in your collection
2. The number of copies you have of each card
3. How many resources you'll get for disenchanting
4. An interface to select which card to disenchant

## What is Disenchanting?

Disenchanting is the process of **breaking down cards** into crafting resources. Think of it as recycling cards you don't need into materials for cards you do need!

### Why Disenchant?

- **Get Crafting Resources** - Convert cards into materials for crafting
- **Manage Duplicates** - Clear out extra copies of cards
- **Progress Your Collection** - Turn what you have into what you need
- **Complete Daily Quests** - Some quests require disenchanting

## Resource Yields

Different rarity cards give different amounts and types of resources:

| Card Rarity | Resources Gained | Example |
|-------------|------------------|---------|
| **Common** | 1 Common Resource | Disenchant 3 commons = Craft 1 common |
| **Uncommon** | 2 Uncommon Resources | Disenchant 3 uncommons = Craft 1 uncommon (needs 5) |
| **Rare** | 3 Rare Resources | Disenchant 3 rares = Craft 1 rare (needs 8) |
| **Legendary** | 6 Legendary Resources | Disenchant 3 legendaries = Craft 1 legendary (needs 15) |
| **Mythic** | 12 Mythic Resources | Disenchant 3 mythics = Craft 1 mythic (needs 30) |

!!! note "Variant Bonuses"
    - **Shiny (<img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/shiny.png" alt="Shiny" class="hp-emoji">) cards:** Give 1.5x resources
    - **Gold (<img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/golden.png" alt="Golden" class="hp-emoji">) cards:** Give 2x resources

## Disenchanting Process

### Step 1: Review Your Collection

Before disenchanting, check what you have:

```
/profile → Collection
```

Look for cards where you have multiple copies. These are prime candidates for disenchanting!

### Step 2: Identify Safe Disenchants

**Safe to Disenchant:**
- Any card where you have 2+ copies (keep 1 of each)
- Common and Uncommon cards with many duplicates
- Cards you're not attached to

**Keep at Least One:**
- Always keep at least 1 copy of each card
- Collection completion requires having one of each
- Some achievements require owning specific cards

### Step 3: Disenchant Cards

1. Use `/disenchant`
2. Browse your cards
3. Select a card to disenchant
4. Confirm the disenchant
5. Receive resources!

## Strategic Disenchanting

### What to Disenchant First

Priority order for disenchanting:

1. **Common Duplicates (3+ copies)** - You'll claim more naturally
2. **Uncommon Duplicates (3+ copies)** - Also claim frequently
3. **Rare Duplicates (2+ copies)** - Keep 1, disenchant extras
4. **Legendary Duplicates** - Only if you have 2+
5. **Mythic Duplicates** - Very rare, consider carefully

### What to Keep

!!! warning "Don't Disenchant These!"
    - Your only copy of any card
    - Shiny (<img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/shiny.png" alt="Shiny" class="hp-emoji">) variants - they're rare and collectible
    - Gold (<img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/golden.png" alt="Golden" class="hp-emoji">) variants - even rarer!
    - Cards needed for achievements
    - Cards you personally like

## Resource Planning

### Calculate Your Needs

Before mass disenchanting, plan what you want to craft:

**Example Plan:**
```
Goal: Craft Albus Dumbledore (Legendary)
Needs: 15 Legendary Resources

Current: 4 Legendary Resources
Needed: 11 more

Strategy: Disenchant 2 duplicate legendary cards
(2 cards × 6 resources = 12 resources total)
```

### Resource Conversion Ratios

Understanding the math helps plan your disenchanting:

| Card Rarity | Disenchant → Craft Ratio |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Common** | 3 cards → 1 card (3 needed, get 1 each) |
| **Uncommon** | ~3 cards → 1 card (5 needed, get 2 each) |
| **Rare** | ~3 cards → 1 card (8 needed, get 3 each) |
| **Legendary** | ~3 cards → 1 card (15 needed, get 6 each) |
| **Mythic** | ~3 cards → 1 card (30 needed, get 12 each) |

## Daily Quest Integration

Disenchanting counts toward daily quests:

- "Disenchant X Common Cards"
- "Disenchant X Uncommon Cards"
- "Disenchant X Rare Cards"
- "Disenchant X Legendary Cards"

**Quest Strategy:**
- Wait to see your daily quests before mass disenchanting
- Disenchant the rarity specified in the quest
- Save your disenchants for quest days when possible

## XP Rewards

Disenchanting also awards XP:

| Card Rarity | XP Reward |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Common** | 10 XP |
| **Uncommon** | 15 XP |
| **Rare** | 25 XP |
| **Legendary** | 50 XP |
| **Mythic** | 100 XP |

Disenchanting multiple cards is a good way to grind XP!

## Advanced Strategies

### Mass Disenchanting

For players with many duplicates:

1. **Sort by Quantity** - Find cards with most copies
2. **Keep 2-3 of Each** - Leave some buffer copies
3. **Disenchant in Bulk** - Process many at once
4. **Track Resources** - Monitor your resource gains

### Resource Hoarding vs Spending

**Hoarding Approach:**
- Save up large amounts of resources
- Craft expensive cards (Legendaries/Mythics)
- Takes patience but feels rewarding

**Spending Approach:**
- Craft cards as soon as you can
- Fill collection gaps immediately
- Feels like faster progress

Both are valid! Choose based on your personality and goals.

### Event Considerations

During special events:
- Resource gains may be boosted
- Event-specific resources might exist
- Consider timing your disenchants for maximum benefit

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Disenchanting Your Only Copy** - Always keep at least one!  
❌ **Disenchanting Shiny/Gold Variants** - These are rare collectibles  
❌ **Mass Disenchanting Without Planning** - Know what you'll craft first  
❌ **Ignoring Quest Requirements** - Check daily quests before disenchanting  
❌ **Hoarding Too Many Duplicates** - Use those resources!  

## Viewing Disenchant Values

To see what resources a card will give:

1. The disenchant interface shows resource gains
2. Higher rarity = more resources
3. Shiny/Gold variants show bonus multiplier
4. Confirm before finalizing to avoid mistakes

## Bulk Disenchanting Tips

!!! tip "Efficient Disenchanting"
    **Best Practices:**
    
    1. **Do Monthly Cleanups** - Disenchant duplicates regularly
    2. **Keep a Buffer** - Maintain 2-3 copies of commons/uncommons
    3. **Focus on Commons First** - They accumulate fastest
    4. **Save Rares** - Only disenchant when you have 3+ copies
    5. **Never Disenchant Variants** - Shiny/Gold cards are collectibles

## Undo Disenchanting

!!! danger "No Undo!"
    Disenchanting is **permanent**. Once you disenchant a card, you cannot get it back without claiming or crafting it again.
    
    Always double-check before confirming!

## Troubleshooting

### "You don't have any copies of this card"
- **Cause:** Card not in your collection or already disenchanted your last copy
- **Solution:** You need to claim or craft the card first

### "Cannot disenchant your only copy"
- **Cause:** Bot protection to prevent accidental collection loss
- **Solution:** This is working as intended - keep at least one!

### "Disenchant command not responding"
- **Cause:** Temporary bot issue
- **Solution:** Wait and try again, or contact support
