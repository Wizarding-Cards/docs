# Daily Routine Guide

Maximise your progress in Wizarding Cards with an optimised daily routine! This guide shows you how to make the most of your time in the game.

## The Ideal Daily Schedule

### Start of Your Day

**1. <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/streak.png" alt="Streak" class="hp-emoji"> Check Your Streak Status**
- Use `/profile` to check your streak status
- Make sure you haven't let your streak expire
- You must claim **within** 12 hours (24 for Aurors) of your last claim
- If you claim **after** the time window expires, your streak resets to 0

**2. <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/quest.png" alt="Quest" class="hp-emoji"> Review Daily Quests**
- Check `/daily` to see which quests you need to complete
- Plan your day around quest requirements
- Remember: Quests reset at midnight GMT/BST
- Use `/daily` to see the countdown timer showing when quests reset in your local time

**3. <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/vote.png" alt="Vote" class="hp-emoji"> Vote for Rewards**
- Use `/vote` to get links to voting sites
- Vote on available sites (each has 12-hour cooldown)
- Earn 10 Galleons and 200 XP per site and reduce your claim cooldown to 20 minutes
- Helps with "Vote Collector" daily quests

**4. <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/card.png" alt="Card" class="hp-emoji"> Your First Claim**
- Use `/claim` to get your first card of the day
- This resets your 30-minute cooldown (20 minutes if you voted, 10 minutes for Aurors)
- Keeps your streak alive
- Earns Galleons and XP

### Throughout the Day

**5. <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/card.png" alt="Card" class="hp-emoji"> Claim Frequently**
- Use `/claim` every 30 minutes (or 20 if you voted, 10 for Aurors) throughout the day
- You can claim **many times per day** - don't wait for specific times!
- Each claim builds your streak, earns rewards, and progresses quests
- Set reminders if you want to maximise your claims

**6. <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/quest.png" alt="Quest" class="hp-emoji"> Check Quest Progress**
- Periodically check `/daily` to see your quest progress
- Plan any remaining actions needed to complete all 4 quests

**7. <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/owned.png" alt="Owned" class="hp-emoji"> Manage Your Collection**
- Use `/disenchant` to convert extra cards into resources (focus on commons/uncommons with many duplicates)
- Use `/craft` to create cards you need with accumulated resources
- Prioritise crafting rares and legendaries
- Check your collection for craftable icons (orange hammer icon)
- Great for completing crafting quests!
- Do this when you have time, not necessarily every day

**8. <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/items.png" alt="Shop" class="hp-emoji"> Shop if Needed**
- Visit `/shop` to buy items that help with your goals
- **Rapid Reclamation Remedy** if you need an extra claim to protect your streak
- **Resource Caches** if you need resources to craft specific cards
- **Frugality Flasks** when crafting expensive Legendary/Mythic cards
- **Rapid Bounty Draught** to maximise cards per claim session

### End of Day

**9. <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/claim.png" alt="Claim" class="hp-emoji"> Final Claim Before Bed**
- Use `/claim` one more time if cooldown has expired
- This extends your streak safety window overnight
- Ensures you won't lose your streak while sleeping

**10. <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/timeturner.png" alt="Timeturner" class="hp-emoji"> Set a Reminder**
- Set an alarm or reminder for 12 hours (24 for Aurors) from your last claim
- This prevents streak loss overnight
- Essential for maintaining long streaks!

## Daily Quest Completion Strategy

Daily quests reset at **midnight GMT/BST** and typically include:

### Quest Type 1: <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/card.png" alt="Card" class="hp-emoji"> Card Claiming
- "Claim X common/uncommon/rare cards"
- **Strategy:** This happens naturally with your normal claiming routine
- Focus on claiming consistently throughout the day

### Quest Type 2: <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/craft.png" alt="Craft" class="hp-emoji"> Card Crafting
- "Craft X common/uncommon/rare cards"
- **Strategy:**
  - Save your resources for craft quest days
  - Focus on cheaper crafts (commons/uncommons) to complete faster
  - Check resource requirements in your profile

### Quest Type 3: <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/disenchant.png" alt="Disenchant" class="hp-emoji"> Card Disenchanting
- "Disenchant X common/uncommon/rare cards"
- **Strategy:**
  - Wait until you see a disenchant quest before mass disenchanting
  - Focus on the rarity specified in the quest
  - Keep at least one of each card before disenchanting

### Quest Type 4: <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/vote.png" alt="Vote" class="hp-emoji"> Voting
- "Vote on X voting sites"
- **Strategy:**
  - Do this early in the day
  - Remember each site has a 12-hour cooldown
  - This is the easiest quest to complete!

!!! tip "Complete All Four Quests"
    Completing all 4 daily quests gives you a **bonus reward**! The reward is multiplied if there's an active Global Vault Key event.

## Weekly Priorities

### Focus on Streaks
- **Week 1-2:** Build your initial streak
- **Week 3-4:** Maintain a consistent streak of 50+
- **Month 1+:** Aim for 100+ streak for maximum benefits

### Resource Management
- **Early game:** Disenchant freely to get crafting materials
- **Mid game:** Be selective about what you disenchant
- **Late game:** Only disenchant excess duplicates

### Collection Goals
- Complete common cards first (easiest to collect)
- Work on uncommon and rare sets
- Legendary and mythic cards will come naturally over time

## Time Investment

**Minimum Daily Time:** ~5-10 minutes
- Quick claims throughout the day
- Check quests and vote

**Optimal Daily Time:** ~15-20 minutes
- Multiple claims spaced out
- Complete all daily quests
- Manage collection (craft/disenchant)
- Shop visits as needed

**Dedicated Sessions:** ~30-45 minutes (once or twice per week)
- Deep dive into collection management
- Plan crafting strategies
- Review leaderboards and compete

## Maintaining Your Streak

!!! danger "Streak Protection Tips"
    Your streak is precious! Here's how to protect it:

    1. **Set Multiple Reminders** - Don't rely on just one
    2. **Claim Before Bed** - Extends your safety window overnight
    3. **Consider Auror** - 24-hour window vs 12-hour makes streak maintenance much easier
    4. **Claim WITHIN the Window** - If you claim after 12 hours (24 for Aurors) have passed, your streak is already lost
    5. **Claim Regularly** - Each claim resets your 12-hour timer, so claim at least once every 12 hours to maintain your streak

## Seasonal Events

During special events (<img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/halloween.png" alt="Halloween" class="hp-emoji"> Halloween, <img src="https://wizarding.cards/assets/emojis/christmas.png" alt="Christmas" class="hp-emoji"> Christmas):

**Extra Currency Farming:**
- Claim frequently to earn event currency (Sweets, Crackers, Coal)
- Participate in event quests for bonus rewards
- Check the seasonal shop for limited-time items

**Event-Specific Quests:**
- These replace or supplement normal daily quests
- Often have better rewards
- May require event currency to complete

- ❌ **Ignoring Daily Quests** - Free rewards every day!
- ❌ **Not Voting** - Easy Galleons and XP
- ❌ **Spending Galleons Randomly** - Save for important items
- ❌ **Letting Streak Die** - Harder to rebuild than maintain
